# Environment

Support Python3.

# Setup

    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    . ./venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Open a FITS file

    python aflak.py my-fits-file.fits

The provided FITS file is required to have an extension with the 'FLUX' name.

After some fiddling you should be able to get a window like below:

# To see a fits file header

    fold -w 80 foo.fits | less

# TODO

- Distribute through PyPI
- Include CI / code checking tools
- Show arbitrary sums over spectral data (currently only show one frame)
- Benchmark / Test with several fits files
- Include GUI way of loading new images
- Include GUI way of showing a fits header
- Set waveform's X-axis to appropriate units
- Set a label on the waveform's Y-axis (flux density [1E-17 erg/s/cm^2/Ang])
- Set a label on the histogram's Y-axis (flux [1E-17 erg/s/cm^2])
- Improve ROI drawing
- Histogram should use logarithm scale by default
- Add a compass showing North and East directions and a scale bar in the unit of arcsec on the image
